Revision history for Perl module String::TtyLength

0.01_05 2020-09-11 NEILB
    - Switched from Text::CharWidth to Unicode::EastAsianWidth,
      as it has more reliable results on CPAN Testers.

0.01_04 2020-09-11 NEILB
    - Ok, lying to the C library about LANG seems to have been a bad idea :-)

0.01_03 2020-09-11 NEILB
    - The C function wcswidth() used by Text::CharWidth needs LANG to be set,
      otherwise you essentially get nonsense back. So now tty_width() checks
      for that before trying to be smart. Set the test case to default
      to "en_US.UTF-8", just to see how that works out with CPAN Testers.

0.01_02 2020-09-11 NEILB
    - Lots of CPAN Testers fails, so put some diagnostics in the tests,
      as there's one test failing that I really didn't expect.

0.01_01 2020-09-10 NEILB
    - Added tty_width() which tries to return the number of columns that
      the string will take up on a terminal.
    - Renamed the basic.t test file as tty_length.t

0.01 2020-09-06 NEILB
    - First release to CPAN
