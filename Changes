    - Lots of CPAN Testers fails, so put some diagnostics in the tests,
      as there's one test failing that I really didn't expect.

0.01_01 2020-09-10 NEILB
    - Added tty_width() which tries to return the number of columns that
      the string will take up on a terminal.
    - Renamed the basic.t test file as tty_length.t
