=head1 NAME

String::TtyLength - calculate length of string excluding ANSI tty codes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Text::Table::Tiny / tty_length /;
 $length = tty_length("\e[1mbold text\e[0m");
 print "length = $length\n";

 # 9

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a single function, C<tty_length>,
which returns the length of a string excluding any ANSI
tty / terminal escape codes.
I.e. the number of characters that will appear on screen.
This is useful if you're working out the width of columns,
or aligning text.

=head2 tty_length( STRING )

Takes a single string,
and returns the length of the string,
excluding any escape sequences.

Note: the escape sequences could include cursor movement,
so the length returned by this function might not be the
number of characters that would be visible on screen.
But C<length_of_string_excluding_escape_sequences()>
was just too long.
